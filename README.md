## Task 2:
## PROJECT SELECTED: (Car Parking System)

## Simple Concept of Car Parking System

![Car](https://github.com/thejas472/VSD-INTERNSHIP/assets/160320685/e65a805b-c217-434f-bead-57770a4bbe74)

### INTRODUCTION:

Drivers searching for parking are estimated to be responsible for about 30% of traffic congestion in cities. Historically, cities, businesses, and property developers have tried to match parking supply to growing demand for parking spaces.

Parking System can be defined as the use of advanced technologies for the better operation, controlling of traffic, and management of parking within an urban area. A number of technologies provide the basis for parking solutions, including vehicle sensors, wireless communications, and data analytics. Parking System is also made useful by recent technology in areas such as mobile appilcation customer services, mobile UPI payments, and in-car GPS navigation systems. At the heart of the parking system concept is the ability to access, collect, analyze, disseminate, and act on information on parking usage. Increasingly, this information is provided in real-time from intelligent devices that enable both parking managers and drivers to optimize the use of parking capacity.
